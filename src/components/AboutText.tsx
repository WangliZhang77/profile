          I'm a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for design and a
          commitment to building <strong>accessible, user-friendly web experiences</strong>.
          Currently, I'm pursuing my Master of Information Technology at the University
          of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, where I'm deepening my understanding of
          modern web technologies and best practices.

          My journey in web development started with a fascination for how clean code
          and thoughtful design come together to create meaningful digital interactions.
          I specialize in <strong>React, TypeScript, and modern CSS</strong>, and I'm
          always exploring new frameworks and tools that can help me build better
          products. I've worked on various projects ranging from internal tools and
          dashboards to full-stack web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving into software development, I had a background in economics,
          which gave me a unique perspective on problem-solving and data analysis.
          This combination of technical skills and analytical thinking allows me to
          approach projects holistically, considering both the user experience and
          the underlying business logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to
          open-source projects, and working on personal side projects. I'm particularly
          interested in <strong>data visualization</strong> and <strong>cloud technologies</strong>,
          and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. If you'd like to
