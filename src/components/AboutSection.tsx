        <p>
          I'm a passionate front-end developer with a deep appreciation for clean code
          and thoughtful design. My journey in web development began with a curiosity
          about how beautiful interfaces come to life, and it has evolved into a
          commitment to building <strong>accessible, performant, and user-friendly</strong>{' '}
          digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm pursuing my Master of Information Technology at the{' '}
          <a href="#" className="inline-link">
            University of Waikato
          </a>{' '}
          in Hamilton, New Zealand, where I'm expanding my knowledge of modern web
          technologies, software engineering principles, and data systems. My academic
          background in economics has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving
          and data analysis, which I bring to every project I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in <strong>React, TypeScript, and modern CSS</strong>, and I'm
          always exploring new frameworks and tools that can help me build better
          products. I've worked on various projects ranging from internal tools and
          dashboards to full-stack web applications, always focusing on creating
          intuitive user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to
          open-source projects, and working on personal side projects. I'm particularly
          interested in data visualization and cloud technologies, and I love learning
          about the latest trends in UI/UX design. I also enjoy playing basketball and
          reading about technology and design in my spare time.
